## KOLIBRI Cloud API daemon example with access token
##### Purpose:
This example code shows basic access to the KOLIBRI Cloud API using a access token from KELLER to gather measurement data from the KOLIBRI Cloud. 
The API's specification can be found here: https://api.kolibricloud.ch/swagger/index.html?url=/swagger/v1/swagger.json

Endpoints interest are:

| Endpoint      | Use to       |  
| ------------- | :----------- | 
| ```GET /v1/Devices```      | Gets information of all devices | 
| ```GET /v1/Devices/{deviceId}```     | Gets information of a specific device  | 
| ```GET /v1/Measurements``` | Gets a list of measurements composed of a value and a UTC datetime | 

##### Needs:
+ **Python 2.7**  (Untested with Python 3.x)
+ **urllib2**

 It is necessary to have a valid *ACCESS_TOKEN*
 Please ask KELLER AG (kolibri@keller-druck.com) to provide a valid *ACCESS_TOKEN* key

##### Notes:
DateTime format from the API are always in **UTC**  
Pressure values from the API are always in **bar**  
Temperature values from the API are always in **Â°C**  
It is not possible to delete measurement data with the API  

If you want to try out the API with [Swagger](https://api.kolibricloud.ch/swagger/index.html?url=/swagger/v1/swagger.json) please us the dark green [Authorize] button and a valid bearer token. You can get a valid bearer token when logged in on www.kolibricloud.ch under [User Settings]
The ```deviceId``` are the same numbers that can be seen in the URL of the WebApp when the device is selected: [https://www.kolibricloud.ch/devices/**1234**/](https://www.kolibricloud.ch/devices/1234/)

If you want a permament *ACCESS_TOKEN*, please contact the KOLIBRI support team (kolibri@keller-druck.com).
The provided access token must be the value with the key "userOid" in the header of every request.

If you plan run this as a server script to store measurement data from the KOLIBRI Cloud API the following procedure is recommended:
+ Decide for a time span to gather date: eg. Every 24h
+ Create a list of the ```deviceId```s that needs to be monitored (eg. ```my_devices=[1234,1235,1236]```)
+ Create a list of MeasurementsDefinitonIds representing the physical measurement channel (eg. ```channels_of_interest=[2,5,7,8,11]```)
+ Run the program every ~24h and
  - for all devices of interest...
  - for all channels of interest..
  - use ```get_data_measurements_from_timespan()``` with he timespan of ~24
  - and store the data into a DB
  - you might check first if the measuremenent(value+timestamp) is not already stored
+ It is possible that a request fails. To solve this error case please re-call the data later again. You might gather data from an overlapped time slot and exclude measurements that has been stored already.
